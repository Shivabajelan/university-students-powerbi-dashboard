## ✅ Conclusion & Next Steps

This dashboard provides a holistic view of the student lifecycle from application to graduation. It enables university stakeholders to:

Track enrolments and applicants in real time.

Identify demographic and geographic trends.

Monitor department performance and graduation outcomes.

Next steps could include integrating predictive analytics (e.g., forecasting enrolments, dropout risk analysis) and automating data refresh for real-time insights.
