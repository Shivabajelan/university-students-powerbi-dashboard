# university-students-powerbi-dashboard
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to provide insights into university studentsâ€™ data. It allows stakeholders (e.g., administrators, academic planners, and faculty) to explore and analyse studentsâ€™ demographics, academic distribution, and department-level details.

The dashboard is structured into multiple tabs, each focusing on specific aspects of the data, with slicers and KPIs for quick filtering and decision-making.
